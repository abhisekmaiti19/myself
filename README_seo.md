<!-- Informations about different seo tags   -->

<!-- Robots meta tags  -->

Index: Tells search engines to index the page. This might seem pointless at first glance since "Index" is the default, but can be useful if you want only a particular group of search engines to index the page.

NoIndex: Tells search engines not to index the page so it won 't appear in search results.

NoImageIndex: Tells search engines not to index the images on a page. However, if someone adds that image somewhere else on the web, Google will still index it and show it in image results.

None: This works as a shortcut for "noindex, nofollow". It tells search engines to ignore the page and pretend they 've never seen it.
Follow: Tells search engines to follow the links it finds on the page. Like with "Index", this is the default status when a bot doesn't find a meta robots tag that applies to it.

NoFollow: Tells search engines not to follow any links on a page at all. You can add this value to an individual link as well.

NoArchive: Tells search engines not to show cached copies of the page.

NoCache: The same thing as "NoArchive" except used by MSN/Live.

NoSnippet: Prevents search engines from showing a snippet for this page in search results. It also prevents them from caching the page.

NoTranslate: Tells search engines not to offer translated versions of the page in search results.

Unavailable_after: Tells search engines not to display the page in search results after a certain date.

NoYDir: This tells the search engine not to use the Yahoo! Directory page description in the search snippet.

NoODP: Prevents search engines from using the description of the page from DMOZ in the search snippet. ODP is the community that runs and maintains the DMOZ directory.
